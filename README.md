 Bitcoin-Price-Tracker : 
I have created this application as part of my iOS App Development course curriculum from Lynda.com(LinkedIn).
The app is a Bitcoin price finder. Major functionality of this app is built by using Cocoapods, networking calls and JSON parsing. 
 The app will give you the latest Bitcoin prices in all the popular, traded currencies, so you can track how well your Bitcoin investments are doing.
