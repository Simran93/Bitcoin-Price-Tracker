#  Bitcoin Ticker

## Our Goal

The objective of this challenge is to  make a Bitcoin price reporter. We are going to use Cocoapods, networking calls and JSON parsing.

Weâ€™re going to make a Bitcoin price ticker. The app will give you the latest Bitcoin prices in all the popular, traded currencies, so you can track how well your Bitcoin investments are doing on the go.
